# Neo4j AI Agent Template

🤖 **An intelligent database assistant that converts natural language questions into Neo4j Cypher queries**

## 🎯 What This Does

Transform your Neo4j database interactions from complex query writing to simple conversations:

- **Before**: `MATCH (c:Customer)-[:HAS_INVOICE]->(i:Invoice) WHERE i.dueDate < date() RETURN c.name`
- **After**: "Show me customers with overdue invoices"

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
   - Neo4j database (Aura or self-hosted)
   - 5-15 minutes for setup

2. **Get Started:**
   - Download `Neo4j_Agent.ipynb` 
   - Upload to Google Colab
   - Follow the step-by-step guide
   - Enter your credentials when prompted

3. **Deploy:**
   - Test locally first
   - Deploy to Google Cloud
   - Share with your team

## 📋 What You'll Get

✅ **Natural Language Database Queries** - Ask questions in plain English  
✅ **Automatic Schema Discovery** - Agent learns your database structure  
✅ **Cloud Deployment** - Accessible to your entire team  
✅ **Read-Only Security** - Safe exploration without data modification
