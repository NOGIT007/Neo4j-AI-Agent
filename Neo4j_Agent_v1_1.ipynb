        "\n",
        "This notebook creates an intelligent database assistant that lets you talk to your Neo4j database in **plain English** instead of writing complex database queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Before vs After\n",
        "- **Before**: You'd need to learn Cypher (Neo4j's query language) to ask your database questions\n",
        "- **After**: You can ask \"Show me all customers with overdue invoices\" and the AI figures out the database query for you\n",
        "\n",
        "### Real-World Example\n",
        "Instead of writing:\n",
        "```cypher\n",
        "MATCH (c:Customer)-[:HAS_INVOICE]->(i:Invoice)\n",

        "RETURN c.name, i.amount\n",
        "```\n",
        "You just ask: **\"Which customers have unpaid invoices that are past due?\"**\n",
