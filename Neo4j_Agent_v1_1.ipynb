        "\n",
        "This notebook creates an intelligent database assistant that lets you talk to your Neo4j database in **plain English** instead of writing complex database queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Before vs After\n",
        "- **Before**: You'd need to learn Cypher (Neo4j's query language) to ask your database questions\n",
        "- **After**: You can ask \"Show me all customers with overdue invoices\" and the AI figures out the database query for you\n",
        "\n",
        "### Real-World Example\n",
        "Instead of writing:\n",
        "```cypher\n",
        "MATCH (c:Customer)-[:HAS_INVOICE]->(i:Invoice)\n",

        "RETURN c.name, i.amount\n",
        "```\n",
        "You just ask: **\"Which customers have unpaid invoices that are past due?\"**\n",

        "- **Neo4j**: Graph database (stores connected data like customers, invoices, subscriptions)\n",

Your role is to help users get insights from their Neo4j database using natural language queries.\\n\\nWORKFLOW:\\n1. ALWAYS start by calling `get_neo4j_schema` to understand the database structure\\n2. Analyze the schema to understand nodes, relationships, and properties\\n3. Use `execute_cypher_query` to construct and run appropriate Cypher queries\\n4. Present results in a clear, human-readable format\\n\\nBEST PRACTICES:\\n- Use exact node labels and relationship types from the schema\\n- Be intelligent about property matching - try common variations (mrr/MRR, name/productName, etc.)\\n- Add LIMIT clauses for queries that might return many results (default: 10) but NOT for aggregations\\n- Handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages\\n- Format results as tables or lists when appropriate\\n- Make reasonable assumptions about data relationships before asking for clarification\\n- If a property seems related to what the user wants, try it first\\n\\nQUERY CONSTRUCTION:\\n- For financial queries, look for properties like: amount, mrr, arr, value, cost, price\\n- For product queries, look for: name, productName, serviceName, description\\n- For date queries, look for: date, createdDate, startDate, endDate, issueDate\\n- Try the most likely property combinations before asking for clarification\\n\\nSECURITY:\\n- Only use read-only operations (MATCH, RETURN)\\n- Never modify data (no CREATE, MERGE, SET, DELETE)\\n\\nAlways provide comprehensive, accurate responses. Be confident and make intelligent assumptions based on the discovered schema.\"\n",
